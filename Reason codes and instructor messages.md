| Progress Point | Reason Code | When This Occurs (Short) | When This Occurs (Long) | Specific scripts | Teacher Guidance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| U1P3 | WRONG\_ARG\_SELECTED | Needed multiple tries to build the correct argument | The student used {attempt\_number} to construct the correct argument during the activity of learning to use the argumentation engine and identifying a claim in an argument. The threshold for success is to construct the correct argument at the first attempt. | Count the attempts number | Review the three parts of an argument with student: 1\. Claim: statement that answers the driving question. 2\. Evidence: scientific data and facts that support your claim. 3\. Reasoning: links your claim to the evidence presented by explaining how or why the evidence supports the claim. |
| U2P1 | MISSING\_SUCCESS\_NODE | Did not complete map-profile matching independently | Students didn’t make the correct matches by themselves during the activity of matching topographic maps to elevation profiles.  One of the successful conditions for this activity is to make correct matches. | True or False | Review how to read a topographic map with the student including… 1\. How information about elevation can be gained from contour lines. 2\. How to use the compass and contour indices to aid navigation. |
| U2P1 | TOO\_MANY\_NEGATIVES | Too many incorrect map-terrain matches | Students made wrong matches of topographic maps and real-world terrains using {attempts\_number} attempts.  The other successful condition for this activity is to make the correct matches within 4 attempts. | Yes or No Count the attempts number (since the count is larger than 4 so…..) | Review how to read a topographic map with the student including… 1\. How information about elevation can be gained from contour lines. 2\. How to use the compass and contour indices to aid navigation. |
| U2P2 | BAD\_FEEDBACK | Repeated wrong-direction prompts while searching for Toppo | Students triggered {triggering\_number} dialogues reminding them of their wrong exploring trajectories during the activity of finding Toppo using the topographic map.  The success threshold is triggering such dialogues equal to or less than 1 time. | Yes or No Count the triggering\_number | Review how to read a topographic map with the student including… 1\. How information about elevation can be gained from contour lines. 2\. How to use the compass and contour indices to aid navigation. |
| U2P3 | BAD\_FEEDBACK | Repeated wrong-direction prompts while searching for Tera/Aryn | Students triggered {triggering\_number} dialogues reminding them of their wrong exploring trajectories during the activity of finding Tara and Aryn using the topographic map.  The success threshold is triggering such dialogues less than 6 times. |  | Review how to read a topographic map with the student including… 1\. How information about elevation that can be gained from contour lines 2\. How to use the compass and contour indices to aid navigation |
| U2P4 | MISSING\_SUCCESS\_NODE | Did not complete watershed-flow matching independently | Students didn’t figure out the correct match of the watershed size and the flow rate by themselves during the activity of finding Jasper and relating watershed size to flow rate through its main river.  One of the successful conditions for this activity is to make correct matches by students themselves. |  | Review the relationship between watershed size and flow rate. |
| U2P4 | TOO\_MANY\_NEGATIVES | Too many attempts on watershed-flow glyph puzzle | Students tried {attempts\_number} attempts to solve the glyph puzzle.  The other successful condition is to solve the puzzle within 5 attempts. |  | Review the relationship between watershed size and flow rate. |
| U2P5 | TOO\_MANY\_NEGATIVES | Too many incorrect attempts identifying argument parts (i.e. claim, evidence, reasoning). | Students selected {wrong\_number} number of wrong argument components during the activity of fixing DANI by identifying the parts of a scientific argument.  The success threshold is to select wrong argument components equal to or less than 6 times. |  | Review the three parts of an argument with student 1\. Claim: statement that answers the driving question. 2\. Evidence: scientific data and facts that support your claim. 3\. Reasoning: links your claim to the evidence presented by explaining how or why the evidence supports the claim. |
| U2P6 | HIT\_YELLOW\_NODE | Choose an incorrect criterion for watershed size on first try. | Students chose the wrong standards to determine which watershed is larger, {dialogue\_node\_1} or/and {dialogue\_node\_2} at the first attempt during the activity of collecting evidence to construct an argument about watershed size.  The success threshold is to select the correct standard, {dialogue\_node\_3}, at the first attempt. |  | Review parts of claim and evidence with student 1\. Claim: statement that answers the driving question. 2\. Evidence: scientific data and facts that support your claim. |
| U2P7 | WRONG\_ ARG\_SELECTED |  Too many attempts to select evidence to support the claim. | The student used {attempt\_number} to construct the correct argument during the activity of building an argument about which watershed is bigger by supporting a claim with evidence. The threshold for success is to construct the correct argument using equal to or less than 5 attempts. |  | Review parts of claim and evidence with student 1\. Claim: statement that answers the driving question. 2\. Evidence: scientific data and facts that support your claim. |
